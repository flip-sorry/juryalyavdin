    <h2>Overview</h2>     
  </section>
  <section class="content-text">
    <p>Yandex.Market is one of the products in the Yandex services ecosystem where sellers show the products they offer and customers find what they are looking for. More than 17,000,000 people use Yandex.Market every month to find and compare products.</p>
    <p>Users can find detailed product descriptions, compare models and prices, filter products using a range of parameters, and read other users’ recommendations.</p>

    <h2>Problem</h2>     
  </section>
  <section class="content-text">
    <p>The previous version of the application was copied its web version so the company decided to transfer it to the cross-platform solution in the way to reduce costs for development. It means the content inside was updated in the background only after the web version of the service had been updated.</p>
    <img class = "content-image" src="../casestudy/market/market-webview.png" width="100%" >
    <p>Unfortunately, as a non-expected result, the app lost its interaction speed and most of the users started leaving it. And after a few months, the support for the project was completely ended.</p>
    <p>All our possible solutions were smashed against the technological barrier that we had created by ourselves. Everything indicated that it was necessary to change the direction of app development and change the technological core of the current platform. But we didn't have the resources for such a huge step.</p>

    <h2>Goal</h2>     
  </section>
  <section class="content-text">
    <p>So I became a part of a three-person discovery team to find a product-market fit for the mobile application that can be a reason to resume the development process again.</p>
    <p>That is how we were started thinking on the acquisition part of the funnel to find the main audience and the best value for them with keeping the current business model.</p>

    <h2>Process</h2>     
  </section>
  <section class="content-text">
    <p>As a result of qualitative research, it turned out that there was a huge part of the market that we still didn't cover with our services.</p>
    <img class = "content-image" src="../casestudy/market/market-graph.jpg" width="100%" >
    <p>The research has confirmed that more than 80% of purchases in Russia were still done offline. People preferred to visit malls and local stores near their homes or workplaces, rather than wait for a courier with parcels in their homes.</p>

      <source src="../casestudy/market/market-custdev.mp4" type="video/mp4">

    </video>
    <p>Based on this data, we conducted interviews with more than 30 respondents and compiled a decent list of JTBD's that gave a starting point. So we started generating hypotheses that were aimed at connecting offline buyers to our service. And every single day, we conducted interviews with people in the malls to gather missing information or test very first prototypes.</p>

    <h2>Solution</h2>     
  </section>
  <section class="content-text">
    <p>Eventually, we found out that the main part of the audience was looking for equal or even similar items in different offline stores to compare their prices and characteristics. So we did it for them with the AI technology of the recognition items on the photos.</p>
    <img class = "content-image" src="../casestudy/market/market-solution.png" width="100%" >
    <p>The new app started to allow customers to take photos of the product in malls to compare it with the others and find the best offer in the nearest mall or even online. This model started to erase the line between online and offline shopping. So people could start choosing items at the mall, and continue shopping at their homes.</p>

    <h2>Results</h2>     
  </section>
  <section class="content-text">
    <p>With the very first version of the application, we increased not only new customers but even daily active users ten times. And as a result, we increased the team up to 40 members in 1,5 years.</p>
    <p>It was probably the most noticeable branch in the history of the app. And after that, the development branch of the mobile app started being the main focus of the company.</p>
    <p>Since the mobile app was launched, the app's audience has grown almost 10 times, and the rating in stores at both stores has risen from 2.8 to 4.7.</p>
