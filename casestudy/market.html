    <h2>Overview</h2>     
  </section>
  <section class="content-text">
    <p>Yandex.Market is one of the products in the Yandex services ecosystem where sellers show the products they offer, and customers find what they are looking for. More than 17,000,000 people use Yandex.Market every month to find and compare products.</p>
    <p>Users can find detailed product descriptions, compare models and prices, filter products using a range of parameters, and read other users' recommendations.</p>

    <h2>Problem</h2>     
  </section>
  <section class="content-text">
    <p>The previous version of the application was a copy of its web product, so the company decided to transfer it to the cross-platform solution to reduce costs for development. So it assumed the content inside to be updated simultaneously with the web version.</p>
    <img class = "content-image" src="../casestudy/market/market-webview.png" width="100%" >
    <p>It was supposed to help eliminate the additional costs of maintaining content on the mobile platform. But unfortunately, as a non-expected result, the app lost its interaction speed, and most of the users churned it, which began to affect the revenue of the service month by month. And after a few months, the business ended the maintenance of the project entirely.</p>
    <p>All our possible solutions smashed against the technological barrier we created by ourselves. Everything indicated that it was necessary to change the direction of app development and change the technical core of the current platform. But at that time product team didn't have the resources for such a huge step.</p>

    <h2>Goal</h2>     
  </section>
  <section class="content-text">
    <p>So that is how we formed an experimental group with me, an analyst, and a product manager to find a product-market fit for the mobile application. The main goal was to find a practical reason to restart the entire mobile service.</p>

    <h2>Process</h2>     
  </section>
  <section class="content-text">
    <h5>Customer journey</h5>
    <p>The primary customer journey of the product usually starts from the initial intent. So, for example, its customers could be looking for new headphones. So they start searching for information on the internet about possible options. It is the very point from which we, as a service, begin to interact with the user until he finds a store to buy.</p>
    <img class = "content-image" src="../casestudy/market/journey.png" width="100%" >
  </section>

  <div class="spacer-2"></div>

  <section class="content-text">
    <h5>Personas</h5>
    <p>Yandex has its in-house research laboratory, and it helped me gather information about our primary potential audience based on their activities.</p>
    <p>As a result, I framed personas. The leading group was women with kids who bought new items only to replace already broken ones and focused on groups of goods of regular consumption.</p>
    <img class = "content-image" src="../casestudy/market/persona.png" width="100%" >
  </section>

  <div class="spacer-2"></div>

  <section class="content-text">
    <h5>JTBD</h5>
    <p>Next, I conducted interviews with people representing each persona and framed primary jobs to be done relevant to the mobile app to understand their motivations and outcomes better.</p>
    <img class = "content-image" src="../casestudy/market/jtbd.png" width="100%" >
  </section>

  <div class="spacer-2"></div>

  <section class="content-text">
    <h5>User research</h5>
    <p>As a result of qualitative research, it turned out that there was a massive part of the market that we still didn't cover with our services.</p>
    <img class = "content-image" src="../casestudy/market/market-graph.jpg" width="100%" >
    <p>The research confirmed that more than 80% of purchases in Russia were still offline. People preferred to visit malls and local stores near their homes or workplaces rather than wait for a courier with parcels in their homes.</p>
    <video class="content-image" width="100%" height="100%" controls autoplay loop>
      <source src="../casestudy/market/market-custdev.mp4" type="video/mp4">
      Your browser does not support video
    </video>
    <p>So there appeared a challenge to bring a new audience from offline to the mobile application. So I went to the mall near the office to run interviews with offline shoppers. The main course there was to find out their behavior. And validate several hypotheses I came up with based on jobs that I previously framed.</p>

    <h2>Solution</h2>     
  </section>
  <section class="content-text">
    <p>Eventually, I found out that the central part of the audience was looking for equal or even similar items in different offline stores to compare their prices and characteristics. So we did it for them with the AI technology of the recognition items on the photos.</p>
    <img class = "content-image" src="../casestudy/market/market-solution.png" width="100%" >
    <p>The new app started to allow customers to take photos of the items in malls to compare them with the others and find the best offer in the nearest mall or online. This model erased the line between online and offline shopping. So people could start choosing items at the mall and continue shopping in their homes.</p>

    <h2>Results</h2>     
  </section>
  <section class="content-text">
    <p>With the very first version of the application, we increased not only new customers but even daily active users ten times. And as a result, we increased the team up to 40 members in 1,5 years.</p>
    <p>It was probably the most noticeable branch in the history of the app. And after that, the development branch of the mobile app started being the main focus of the company.</p>
    <p>Since the mobile app was launched, the app's audience has grown almost 10 times, and the rating in stores at both stores has risen from 2.8 to 4.7.</p>
