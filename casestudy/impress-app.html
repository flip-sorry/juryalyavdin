    <h2>Overview</h2>     
  </section>
  <section class="content-text">
    <p>Impress, Europeâ€™s leading chain of orthodontic clinics has made its mark in 9 countries, spanning over 130 cities. The Impress clear aligners, recommended by seasoned orthodontists with over 15 years of experience, are a testament to the brand's promise: revolutionizing smiles in a discreet, comfortable, and efficient manner. The Impress medical team, known for its expertise, collaborates seamlessly to craft personalized treatment plans that are projected to yield results in under six months. Their dedication has led to an impressive achievement: more than 50,000 patients wearing radiant and perfectly aligned smiles.</p>

    <h2>Context</h2>     
  </section>
  <section class="content-text">
    <p>Impress patients, especially adults, prefer clear aligners because they are virtually invisible, allowing them to undergo orthodontic treatment without the aesthetic concerns associated with traditional metal braces.</p>
    <img class = "content-image" src="../casestudy/impress-app/customer.png" width="100%">
    <p>Impress company uses advanced imaging technology, such as 3D scanners, to create a highly accurate digital model of the patient's teeth. These models are then used to design and manufacture the series of custom aligners. The aligners are typically made from a clear, medical-grade plastic that is both strong and transparent.</p>
    <p>Here's a breakdown of how such treatments typically work:</p>
    <img class = "content-image" src="../casestudy/impress-app/journey01.png" width="100%">
    <p>The journey begins digitally, where future patients encounter Impress either via organic searches, informative blog posts, or captivating paid ads. Drawn to the clinics, their initial visit facilitates a mutual commitment: patients entrust their smiles and, with a prepayment, anchor their treatment journey.</p>
    <img class = "content-image" src="../casestudy/impress-app/patient.jpeg" width="100%">
    <p>Craftsmanship ensues as bespoke aligners are meticulously crafted for each patient. With the treatment's onset, some collect their kits personally from clinics, while others opt for doorstep delivery. Slipping on the first aligner marks the commencement of their transformative phase.</p>

    <h2>Problem</h2>     
  </section>
  <section class="content-text">
    <p>While the Impress aligners are adept at achieving transformative dental results, the process has inherent challenges. Patients shift between multiple sets of aligners throughout their treatment, transitioning every few weeks that mandate validation from a dental professional, leading to frequent clinic visits. These repetitive appointments deplete the clinic's time and resources by overloading clinic capacity. Considering the customer acquisition costs and costs of clinic maintenance, the patient visit can cost the company 50 to 600 euros, depending on the daytime and clinic location.</p>
    <h5>Objective</h5>
    <p>Minimize operational expenses and Improve clinic scheduling and time management, leading the patient through the process and boosting the overall experience associated with the company.</p>

    <h2>Solution</h2>     
  </section>
  <section class="content-text">
    <p>To address the challenges discerned during the research phase, I proposed the development of an innovative mobile application, proving the model on the existing and potential customers and justifying the economic value. This platform served as the crux for patient and orthodontic team interactions and was infused with features to streamline and amplify the user experience.</p>
    <div class="spacer-1"></div>
    <h5>Kit delivery</h5>
    <p>The transition from the initial offline clinic experience to our online platform is a crucial juncture where the patient's journey takes a leap toward digital engagement. My strategy here was to design an informative and reassuring kit delivery process that begins with educating the patient about the manufacturing stage. A series of personalized emails and app notifications provide real-time updates on the production of their custom aligners, building anticipation and trust in the product's quality.</p>
    <video class="content-image" width="100%" height="100%" controls autoplay loop>
      <source src="../casestudy/impress-app/sol01.mp4" type="video/mp4">
      Your browser does not support video
    </video>
    <p>Upon dispatch, patients receive a detailed timeline, including tracking information for their kit delivery. This communication is critical as it prepares them for the start of their treatment, ensuring they're ready to begin as soon as their kit arrives. The delivery is not just a parcel but a pivotal touchpoint that marks the commitment to their new smile journey.</p>
    <div class="spacer-1"></div>
    <h5>Onboarding</h5>
    <p>The onboarding phase is designed to be an immersive and educational experience. When patients receive their treatment kit, they find a well-organized package along with an intuitive mobile app to guide them through the initial setup. The app includes a series of interactive tutorials that visually and verbally guide patients on how to use their aligners correctly. This process is vital to ensure patient confidence and proper use of the aligners from day one.</p>
    <video class="content-image" width="100%" height="100%" controls autoplay loop>
      <source src="../casestudy/impress-app/sol02.mp4" type="video/mp4">
      Your browser does not support video
    </video>
    <p>To augment this experience, I built 3D models of the treatment kit and incorporated a series of made-in-house short looped videos that show patients detailed instructions reflecting each step needed. The onboarding is not just instructional but also aims to empower patients with the knowledge and tools they need to take control of their treatment.</p>
    <div class="spacer-1"></div>
    <h5>Treatment and communication</h5>
    <p>For the ongoing treatment process, the mobile application is central to maintaining treatment efficacy and patient engagement. A critical feature is the wear-time tracking suggestion, which gently nudges patients to maintain the recommended 22 hours of aligner use per day. The app includes a timer and a daily log where patients can track their wear time, receive reminders, and celebrate milestones to stay motivated.</p>
    <video class="content-image" width="100%" height="100%" controls autoplay loop>
      <source src="../casestudy/impress-app/sol03.mp4" type="video/mp4">
      Your browser does not support video
    </video>
    <p>Progress tracking is facilitated through a feature where patients capture and upload photos of their teeth after completing each step of their treatment. These images are sent to their orthodontist through a HIPAA-compliant platform within the app, enabling the doctor to review and approve the transition to the next aligner set remotely, minimizing clinic visits.</p>
    <p>Additionally, a built-in messenger function allows real-time communication with the patient care team. This ensures that any concerns or questions can be addressed promptly, providing a continuous support system. It also offers the flexibility for the care team to check in with patients, ensuring they feel guided and cared for throughout their treatment journey.</p>
    <img class = "content-image" src="../casestudy/impress-app/sol04.png" width="100%">
    <p>By enhancing each of these phases with thoughtful, user-centric features, I aimed to ensure a smooth, informed, and engaging treatment process for Smile2Impress patients, leading to a higher level of satisfaction and better treatment outcomes.</p>
